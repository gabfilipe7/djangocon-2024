## Announcing DjangoCon Europe 2024

We are happy to announce DjangoCon Europe 2024 will take place in Porto, Portugal üáµüáπ hopefully! Let us explain, and believe us that there is a lot to explain.

DjangoCon Europe is hosted annually by an independent volunteer team. This volunteer team submits a proposal to DSF, which will then select the most suitable one from all the proposals. We knew from the start it would be daunting for a new team to submit for 2024, in these uncertain times. So, we pledged our availability to host another DjangoCon, but only if there was no other team submitting a proposal.

Do not get us wrong, we love the idea of welcoming you all in our city and country, we have been trying for the last two years, but we felt we should give other teams the chance, so we have not submitted an official proposal, just a backup plan, most of all we didn‚Äôt want to spend a year without a DjangoCon Europe.

Being here means no other team was available, understandingly so. Our main advantage is: having organised the previous two editions we are able to quickly set up keeping up the momentum.

We will try for the third time to host an in-person event, but a safe one. This means it will be hybrid from the start, both for speakers and participants. We want to give freedom of choice as well as being prepared for unforeseeable issues, which seem to be the new normal. Please keep in mind this might change in a heartbeat and we might end up with yet another online-only event, but let us hope for a bit more.

On another note, you might have noticed the unusual dates for DjangoCon Europe, which usually takes place during the first half of the year. DSF tried to find a new team to host, but due to the lack of viable proposals eventually contacted us in mid-November. Finding a suitable date on such short notice, avoiding other events, and booking a venue left us with little to no choices. To this end, we would like to thank both DEFNA and DSF for the exceptional permission as it will be unusually close to DjangoCon US.

So, DjangoCon Europe 2024 is back again and it‚Äôs going to be 5 full days of talks, tutorials and sprints - from September 21 to 25:

* ** Conference talks: ** September 21-23 (Wednesday-Friday)
* ** Sprints: ** September 24-25 (Saturday and Sunday)

In the near future, we will have more info about the conference, which we will publish on the website. This will include more details about the tickets, talks, workshops, grants, code of conduct, etc. For now, here is a summary of that info.

### Grants

As with past years, there will be a travel grants program to assist people with financial difficulties, people who are under-represented or from marginalised groups - allowing access to an event that otherwise would be very difficult position for them to attend;

### Sponsors

If you're interested in sponsoring the event, please get in touch at [sponsors@djangocon.eu](mailto:sponsors@djangocon.eu).

### Talk proposals

You can already start to prepare your talk, and for that, we recommend that you watch the talk [‚ÄúHow To Get On This Stage (And What To Do When You Get There)‚Äù by Mark Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rsL974kwsE){:target="_blank"}. If you think you have something great to talk about ‚Äì start to prepare your talk! If you are unsure, talk it over with somebody, or go to [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/djangoconeurope/shared_invite/zt-1gjg5lqkz-qVQkNnhjztXVme7TQ7ziQA){:target="_blank"} to find previous speakers and participants to discuss your idea with. When in doubt, submit your talk!

Volunteers

Your location before and during the event is not significant, since it will be hosted in a hybrid format. We can do all things that need to be done in Porto ourselves. The only important thing is that you have the energy and free time to help organize a wonderful DjangoCon Europe. The official language of all these prior activities will be English, as well as the conference itself.
