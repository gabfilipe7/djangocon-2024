At the end of each day, DjangoCon Europe 2024 will feature the "**Seven Bridges Boat Cruise**" on the Douro River for all the participants free of charge. Due to the large number of participants, we'll do 3 boat rides, with the participants being divided in 3 groups (one for each day). [**You need to sign up** to one of the dates to be able to hop on the boat cruise!](https://forms.gle/j3CSxu5xey6JquAa8){target: "_blank"} Max. 1 boat ride per participant, subject to availability.

With the offer of a free boat ride, we are hoping to make it inclusive for everyone to participate in the social part of the conference without the cost being an issue :) A special thank you to Platform.sh, Kolo and Sentry for helping us make this possible!
